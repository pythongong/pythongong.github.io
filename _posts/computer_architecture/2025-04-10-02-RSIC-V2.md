RISC-V can transfer a whole word from the memory to the register, which is called word data transfer instruction. On a 32-bit system, main memory contains $2^{32}$bytes. Every 32-bit or 4-bytes number acts as the address of one byte. So if you want to read a 4-bytes word, you’ll read 4 addresses. RISC-V uses **little-endian** to store data: The least significant byte gets stored at the lowest address. By convention we say that a word is stored at its lowest address. Ex. The word stored at address 0x1000 is composed of the bytes 0x1000, 0x1001, 0x1002, and 0x1003.

**Load instructions** read bytes into a register. The source may be a constant value, another register, or a location in memory. This instruction loads a whole word. 

```bash
lw x10 12(x5)
```

Assume x5 stores the address 0x100, 12(x5) means 0x100+12 = 0x10C. The register x10 will now store the bytes of the address that starts from 0x10C. It will store 4 bytes between 0x10C-0x10F , which are 0x53, 0x42, 0x56, 0x00.  So the register x10 will now store 0x0056 4253. 

**Store instructions** are basically the reverse of load instructions—they move values from registers back out to memory. There is no path in a RISV architecture to move bytes from one place in memory to somewhere else in memory. Instead, you need to use loads first and then loads to move them back to memory. This instruction stores a whole word. 

```bash
sw x10 0(x5)
```

Assume x5 stores the address 0x100, 0(x5) means 0x100+0 = 0x100. If the register x10 stores four bytes 0x1234 5678, the bytes in memory 0x100, 0x101, 0x102, and 0x103 get set to 0x78, 0x56, 0x34, and 0x12, respectively.

In addition to word data transfers, RISC-V has byte data transfers, which load and store one byte instead of a full word.

**Store a byte**

```bash
sb x10 0(x5)
```

If x5 is 0x100, x10 is 0x1234 5678. We store the least significant byte: 0x78. So x100 gets set to 0x78

**Load a byte**

```bash
lb x10 0(x5)
```

If x5 is 0x100 and bytes at 0x100 are 0xEF. Then the register 10 stores 0xEF. Then we extend the numeric value of 0xEF to a full 32 bits. What 32-bit number has the same numeric value as 0xEF?

This instruction uses sign-extension, so x10 will store 0xFFFF FFEF.

If you want to use zero extension, there is another instruction

```bash
lbu x10, 0(x15)
```

To store a immediate, we use li instruction. An immediate is limited to 12 bits. When you perform an operation with an immediate, it is sign extended to 32-bits. 

```bash
li x10, 5 
```

RSIC-V has instructions that load/store halfword, which is 2-byte blocks. 

```bash
lh x1 x2
lhu x1 x2 # use zero-exstension
sh x1 x2
```

**Label** in RISC-V can be used to store the address of a word which can be data or an instruction. We can load the address of the label

```bash
la x1 array
```

It loads the address of the label ‘array’ into the register x1.

**Data transfer example**

```bash
addi x11,x0,0x3F5
sw x11,0(x5)
lb x12,1(x5)
```

Assumptions

| Register | Value |
| --- | --- |
| x11 | 0x00000000 |
| x12 | 0x00000000 |
| x5  | 0x00000100 |

| Byte (0x) | F5 | 93 | 00 | 00 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Address (0x) | 100 | 101 | 102 | 103 |

After the first line of code: x11 = 0x00 00 03 F5

After the second line of code: x11 = 0x 00 00 93 F

Finally, x12 stores the bytes at 0x101. 0x93 = 0b1001 0011. Top bit is 1, so we fill F and x12 = 0x FF FF FF 93.
