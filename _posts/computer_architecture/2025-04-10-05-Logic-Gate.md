To design circuits that perform complex operations on binary signals:

1. Define primitive operators.
2. Compose these primitive operators to perform more complex operations.

Primitive operators for combinational logic are called logic gates. The simplest logic gates are unary/binary operators that take as input one/two binary variables and output one binary value.

AND, OR,  NOT gate: Perform the operation on the binary one bit at a time

- Ex. 0b1001 | 0b0111 = 0b1111
- Ex. 0b1001 & 0b0111 = 0b0001
- Ex. ~0b1001 = 0b0110

NAND(a, b) = 1 IFF AND(a, b) = 0

NOR(a, b) = 1 IFF OR(a, b) = 0

XOR(a, b) = 1 IFF a ≠ b

$$
\overline{a} b+a\overline{b}
$$

XNOR

$$
\overline{a} \overline {b}+ab
$$

The symbol for common gates

  NOT              AND                     OR                     XOR                    NAND               NOR                 XNOR

To compose the gates:

1. Construct the truth table for the function definition by enumerating all input/output pairs.
2. Use the truth table to write the canonical form, like $y = abc + ab\bar c$
 .
3. Use the laws of Boolean algebra to simplify the expressions.
4. Construct the gate diagram.
