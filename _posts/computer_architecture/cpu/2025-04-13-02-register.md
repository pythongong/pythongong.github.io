A register is a special circuit that “stores information” for a period of time. We use a special input signal as a trigger. When on trigger, it inputs the sample and transfer it to new output. At all other times, it ignores the input and outputs the old value. It controls flow of information between combinational logic blocks such as the sum of two numbers. 

Synchronous digital systems coordinate all operations by a central clock. By contrast, asynchronous systems must locally coordinate actions and communications b/t components, which is much harder to design/debug.

The picture below shows a conventional register design:

- D: Data
- Q: Output
- CLK: signal

Flip-flop (FF) is a 1-bit register named as such because the output “flips and flops” between 0 and 1. An n-bit wide register is a parallel collection of n flip-flops

On the rising edge of CLK (signal), each FF captures the input value d, stores it internally, and transfers it to output q. As physical components, flip-flops (and therefore registers) have timing constraints:

- Setup time: How long input must be stable before the rising edge of the clock.
- Hold time: How long the input must be stable after the rising edge of the clock. Hold Time ≤ clk-to-Q + best case combinational delayl
- CLK-to-Q delay: How long it takes the output to change, as measured from the rising edge of the CLK


The higher our frequency, the higher the bandwidth of our circuit, i.e., the faster we can produce outputs per second. As the clock runs faster, the state elements change faster 
Clock frequency f is in Hz (or GHz) and clock period T is in seconds. 

$$
f = \frac 1 T
$$

Minimum clock period = delay on the critical path.  A critical path is the path between input(s) and output(s) that incurs maximum delay including

- CLK-to-q time (to get the output of the registers)
- Worst-case combinational logic delay
- Setup time for the next register

The clock period must be longer than the critical path. Run the clock any faster, and your circuit becomes unstable. Inserting an i**ntermediate pipeline registe**r allows higher clock frequency. For example, it can pipeline the shifter outputs while the next adder input is being computed 

A group of registers are called a **register file**. It manages which registers get changed and

which register outputs get read.

For a 32-bit register file, its inputs are:

- One 32-bit input bus, dataW.
- Three 5-bit selectors, rs1, rs2, and rsW
- RegWEn control bit (Write Enabled)

It outputs two 32-bit output busses which are the data in rs1 and rs2.

Clock behavior:

- If Write Enable is 1 on rising clock edge, set the register corresponding to rsW's data to dataW
- Reading the value of a register doesn't take a clock tick (getting data1/data2). Only Writing to the register takes a tick.
- Note that data computed in cycle N get written on the rising edge of the next cycle.
