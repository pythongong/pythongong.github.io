There are two kinds of events which cause the CPU to set aside ordinary execution of instructions and force a transfer of control to special code in the kernel that handles the event.

**Exception**

- Caused by an event during the execution of the current program. The event is usually an instruction (user or kernel) does something illegal, such as divide by 0 or use an invalid virtual address.
- Synchronous: it must be handled immediately.

**Hardware interrupt** or simply interrupt

- Caused by an event external to the current running program. The event usually occurs when a device signals that it needs attention, for example when the disk hardware finishes a read or write request.
- Asynchronous: It does not need to be handled immediately.

When a hardware interrupt occurs, the CPU pauses its current task, saves its state, and jumps to an **interrupt service routine** (ISR) that handles the specific interrupt. After handling the interrupt, the CPU resumes its previous task.

Executing system calls or dealing with exceptions requires another mechanism, called **trap**, that allow the OS to take control of the CPU. The special instruction that raises the hardware privilege level is called a **trap instruction**. The special instruction that lowers the hardware privilege level is called a **return-from-trap instruction**.

The **trap handler** is the code that services exceptions and system calls:

- Complete all instructions before the faulting instruction
- Flush all instructions after the faulting instruction.
- Transfer execution to trap handler (runs in supervisor mode). Optionally return to original program and re-execute instruction

How does the trap know which code to run inside the OS in a trap? Clearly, the calling process canâ€™t specify an address to jump to as it will allow the user program to jump anywhere into the kernel. Instead, the kernel does so by setting up a **trap table** in kernel mode at boot time.  The system call number is also set in the trap table. The trap table informs the hardware of the locations of the ****trap handlers.
