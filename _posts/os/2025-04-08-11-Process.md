The unit of isolation in the OS is a **process** which is simply a running program. The process abstraction prevents one process from wrecking or spying on another process’s memory, CPU, file descriptors, etc. It also prevents a process from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process can’t subvert the kernel’s isolation mechanisms. The kernel must implement the process abstraction with care because a buggy or malicious application may trick the kernel or hardware into doing something bad (e.g., circumventing isolation). The mechanisms used by the kernel to implement processes include the user/supervisor mode flag, address spaces, and time-slicing of threads.

To help enforce isolation, the process abstraction provides the illusion to a program that it has its own private machine. It provides a program with what appears to be a private memory system, or address space, which other processes cannot read or write. A process also provides the program with what appears to be its own CPU to execute the program’s instructions. 

Process APIs available on any modern operating system

- Create: When you type a command into the shell, or double-click on an application icon, the OS is invoked to create a new process to run the program you have indicated.
- Destroy: When the process don’t exit when complete, the user may wish to kill them.
- Wait: To wait for a process to stop running
- Exit: To stop the calling process and to release resources such as memory and open files. Exit takes an integer status argument, conventionally 0 to indicate success and 1 to indicate failure.
- Miscellaneous Control: For example, most operating systems provide some kind of method to suspend a process (stop it from running for a while) and then resume it (continue it running).
- Status: To get some status information about a process.

Most systems also allow a process to create child processes. For example, the shell executes most commands by creating a child process: 

1. Shell forks (in Linux) a child process. 
2. The OS starts the program and then the program is running. 
3. Shell then waits for the main function of the program to return (join) 

A process can be in one of three states: 

- Running
- Ready: In the ready state, a process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has chosen not to run it at this given moment.
- Blocked: In the blocked state, a process has performed some kind of operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place. For example,  when a process initiates an I/O request to a disk, it becomes blocked and thus some other process can use the processor.

Being moved from ready to running means the process has been **scheduled**; being moved from running to ready means the process has been **de-scheduled**. These types of decisions are made by the OS **scheduler** 

Sometimes a system will have an **initial state** that the process is in when it is being created.

Also, a process could be placed in a **final state** where it has exited but has not yet been cleaned up  
In UNIX-based systems, this is called the **zombie state**.  This final state can be useful as it allows other processes (usually the parent that created the process) to examine the return code of the process. 

To track the state of each process, for example, the OS likely will keep some kind of **process list** for all processes that are ready and some additional information to track which process is currently running. Each entry of the list is called a **process control block** (PCB), which is really just a structure that contains information about a specific process, including the **register context** will hold the contents of its registers for a blocked or ready process.
