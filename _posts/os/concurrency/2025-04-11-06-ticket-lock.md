One final hardware primitive is the **fetch-and-add instruction**, which atomically increments a value while returning the old value at a particular address. The C pseudocode for the fetch-and-add instruction looks like this:

```c
int FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {
    int old = *ptr;
    *ptr = old + 1;
    return old;
}
```

In this example, we’ll use fetch-and-add to build a **ticket lock**. Instead of a single value, this solution uses a ticket and turn variable in combination to build a lock. 

The basic operation is pretty simple: when a thread wishes to acquire a lock, it first does an atomic fetch-and-add on the ticket value, which is considered as this thread’s “turn” (my->turn). The globally shared lock->turn is then used to determine which thread will run. When (my->turn ==  lock->turn) for a given thread, it is that thread’s turn to acquire the lock. Unlock is accomplished simply by incrementing the turn such that the next waiting thread can now enter the critical section.

This approach ensures progress for all threads which is not guaranteed in our previous attempts.
